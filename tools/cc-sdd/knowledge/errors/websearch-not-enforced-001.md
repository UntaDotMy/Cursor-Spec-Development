# Error: WebSearch Integration Not Working - AI Ignoring Research Commands

## Error Details
- **Error Type**: Implementation Logic Error - SOLVED
- **Context**: Enhanced /kiro commands not enforcing WebSearch research before proceeding
- **File/Location**: Template files in `tools/cc-sdd/templates/agents/`
- **Date**: 2025-09-18

## Problem Description
The AI agents (Claude Code, Cursor IDE, Gemini CLI) were ignoring the "MANDATORY" WebSearch research steps in the enhanced /kiro commands and proceeding with their limited knowledge instead of researching first.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Templates were just documentation**: The /kiro commands are Markdown templates that describe what SHOULD happen, but don't FORCE the AI to do it
2. **"MANDATORY" was just text**: Labels like "MANDATORY" and "CRITICAL" were suggestions, not enforced requirements
3. **No validation mechanism**: There was no check to ensure research was actually performed
4. **AI could override instructions**: The AI could decide to skip steps if it thought it already knew the answer

## Research Conducted
- **Search Queries Used**: 
  - "claude code slash commands implementation how /kiro commands work"
  - "cursor IDE agents.md file format custom commands implementation"
  - "claude code custom slash commands markdown implementation .claude/commands directory"
  - "claude code slash commands conditional logic force tool usage mandatory steps"
  - "AI assistant prompt engineering force mandatory actions before proceeding"
- **Sources Checked**:
  - GitHub: Reviewed cc-sdd original repository structure
  - Web: Found general information about development assistant integration
  - Code Analysis: Examined current template structure

## Solutions Attempted
1. **Solution 1**: Adding "MANDATORY" labels and detailed instructions
   - **Result**: Failure - AI still ignored the steps
   - **Notes**: Text labels don't enforce behavior

2. **Solution 2**: Detailed step-by-step research instructions
   - **Result**: Failure - AI skipped research if it thought it knew
   - **Notes**: AI interpreted instructions as suggestions

## Working Solution - IMPLEMENTED ✅

**Strategy**: Restructured templates to make WebSearch research TRULY mandatory by using psychological enforcement and validation checkpoints:

### 1. Psychological Enforcement
- Added prominent warning sections with ⚠️ symbols
- Used phrases like "YOU CANNOT PROCEED" and "NO EXCEPTIONS"
- Structured commands with clear validation checkpoints
- Made research a prerequisite for subsequent steps

### 2. Template Structure Changes
- **STEP 1: FORCED RESEARCH PHASE (CANNOT BE SKIPPED)**
- **STEP 2: VALIDATION CHECKPOINT** with explicit checkboxes
- **STEP 3: CONTEXT LOADING (ONLY AFTER RESEARCH COMPLETED)**
- **STEP 4: REQUIREMENTS GENERATION (RESEARCH-INFORMED)**

### 3. Specific Implementation Changes

#### spec-requirements.tpl.md:
```markdown
## ⚠️ CRITICAL: MANDATORY RESEARCH FIRST ⚠️
**YOU CANNOT PROCEED TO REQUIREMENTS GENERATION WITHOUT COMPLETING RESEARCH FIRST**

## STEP 1: FORCED RESEARCH PHASE (CANNOT BE SKIPPED)
### 1.1 Execute Mandatory WebSearch (NO EXCEPTIONS)
**STOP HERE AND PERFORM RESEARCH IMMEDIATELY - DO NOT PROCEED WITHOUT COMPLETING THIS**

1. **REQUIRED WebSearch Query 1**: Search for "latest version [technology] 2024"
   - **EXECUTE NOW**: Use WebSearch tool immediately
   - **REQUIRED OUTPUT**: Save results to knowledge directory

## ✅ STEP 2: VALIDATION CHECKPOINT
**BEFORE PROCEEDING TO REQUIREMENTS, VERIFY YOU HAVE COMPLETED:**
- [ ] ✅ Executed WebSearch Query 1 and saved results
- [ ] ✅ Have real web research data (not assumptions)
**IF ANY CHECKBOX IS EMPTY, STOP AND GO BACK TO STEP 1**
```

#### spec-impl.tpl.md:
```markdown
### 1.2 Knife Surgery Preparation (MANDATORY - CANNOT BE SKIPPED)
**⚠️ CRITICAL: THIS STEP CANNOT BE BYPASSED ⚠️**
**YOU MUST READ TARGET FILES BEFORE ANY CODE CHANGES - NO EXCEPTIONS**

1. **MANDATORY Target File Reading**:
   - **EXECUTE NOW**: Use Read tool to read ALL target files that will be modified
   - **CANNOT PROCEED**: Until you have read and analyzed target files

**CHECKPOINT**: You cannot proceed to TDD implementation until you have completed file reading and analysis.

**Step 5: SELF-REVIEW & MISTAKE CHECK (MANDATORY - CANNOT BE SKIPPED)**
**⚠️ YOU MUST PERFORM THIS STEP - NO EXCEPTIONS ⚠️**
- **EXECUTE NOW**: Use Read tool to re-read ALL modified files completely
**VALIDATION CHECKPOINT**: Confirm ALL modified files have been re-read and checked for mistakes before proceeding.
```

### 4. Files Updated
- ✅ `templates/agents/claude-code/commands/os-mac/spec-requirements.tpl.md`
- ✅ `templates/agents/claude-code/commands/os-windows/spec-requirements.tpl.md`
- ✅ `templates/agents/claude-code/commands/os-mac/spec-impl.tpl.md`
- ✅ `templates/agents/claude-code/commands/os-windows/spec-impl.tpl.md`

## Implementation Details

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Strong Visual Warnings**: Used ⚠️ symbols and ALL CAPS to grab attention
2. **Explicit Action Commands**: "EXECUTE NOW" instead of "should do"
3. **Validation Checkpoints**: Required confirmation before proceeding
4. **Cannot Proceed Logic**: Structured so next steps depend on previous completion
5. **Psychological Pressure**: Phrases that make ignoring steps feel wrong

### Why This Solution Works:
1. **Creates Cognitive Pressure**: Hard to ignore visually prominent warnings
2. **Step Dependencies**: Later steps explicitly require previous step outputs
3. **Validation Gates**: Checkboxes create psychological commitment
4. **Action-Oriented Language**: Commands rather than suggestions
5. **Failure Consequences**: Clear statements about what happens if skipped

## Verification Needed
- [ ] Test with Claude Code to ensure WebSearch is actually executed
- [ ] Verify knowledge files are created before requirements generation
- [ ] Confirm target files are read before code modification
- [ ] Test self-review step forces file re-reading

## Status
- [x] Error identified and analyzed
- [x] Root cause determined  
- [x] Research conducted
- [x] Solution designed and implemented
- [x] Template files updated with enforcement mechanisms
- [ ] Solution verified with real testing

## Prevention for Future
1. **Always use action-oriented language** in templates
2. **Create step dependencies** so AI cannot skip ahead
3. **Use visual warnings** and psychological enforcement
4. **Test templates** with real AI agents to verify compliance
5. **Monitor for bypass attempts** and strengthen enforcement if needed

## Next Steps
1. Update Cursor IDE and Gemini CLI templates with same enforcement pattern
2. Test the enhanced templates with actual /kiro commands
3. Document successful enforcement patterns for future template updates
