# Enhanced Information Gathering Rules

## Web Search for 2025-2026 Content
Instead of Context7, use web search tools to get the most current information:

## Search Strategy Guidelines
1. **Always search for the latest information** - Include "2025" or "2026" in search queries
2. **Focus on best practices and examples** - Always look for practical examples and proven approaches
3. **Search for multiple perspectives** - Try different query variations to get comprehensive coverage
4. **Prioritize authoritative sources** - Official docs, GitHub, Stack Overflow, major tech blogs

## Required Search Patterns

### Technology Information
```
Search: "[technology] latest version 2025 2026 features changes"
Search: "[framework] [version] best practices examples 2025"
Search: "[library] documentation examples getting started 2025"
Search: "[technology] vs alternatives comparison 2025 2026"
```

### Implementation Guidance with Examples
```
Search: "[project-type] [technology] implementation tutorial examples 2025"
Search: "[framework] project setup guide best practices 2025 2026"
Search: "[technology] [use-case] example code best practices 2025"
Search: "how to build [project-type] with [technology] examples 2025"
Search: "[technology] real world examples production ready 2025"
```

### Problem Solving with Examples
```
Search: "[error-message] [technology] solution fix examples 2025"
Search: "[technology] common issues problems solutions examples 2025 2026"
Search: "[framework] troubleshooting guide examples 2025"
Search: "[technology] debugging tips examples best practices 2025"
```

### Best Practices with Code Examples
```
Search: "[technology] best practices examples 2025 2026"
Search: "[project-type] security practices examples 2025"
Search: "[framework] performance optimization examples 2025"
Search: "[technology] code examples best practices 2025"
Search: "[technology] production ready examples 2025"
```

## Priority Search Sources (In Order)
1. **GitHub** - `site:github.com [technology] [feature] examples 2025 2026`
2. **Reddit** - `site:reddit.com r/webdev r/programming [technology] 2025`
3. **GitLab** - `site:gitlab.com [technology] implementation examples 2025`
4. **Stack Overflow** - `site:stackoverflow.com [technology] 2025 solution`
5. **Official Documentation** - `[technology] official documentation 2025 2026`

## Search Quality Criteria
**Prioritize results that are:**
- Published in 2025-2026 (or late 2024)
- From GitHub repositories with recent activity and good documentation
- From Reddit discussions with high engagement (r/webdev, r/programming, r/reactjs, etc.)
- From GitLab projects with comprehensive examples
- Include practical examples and code samples with comments
- Address your specific use case with real-world examples
- Show best practices with detailed explanations

**Avoid results that are:**
- Older than 2024 (unless for historical context)
- From unreliable or spam sites
- Too generic or not relevant to your specific needs
- Without code examples or practical guidance
- Theoretical content without practical implementation

## Multi-Search Strategy
For comprehensive coverage, perform multiple searches:

1. **Overview Search**: "[technology] overview guide examples 2025"
2. **Specific Feature Search**: "[technology] [specific-feature] implementation examples 2025"
3. **Best Practices Search**: "[technology] best practices production examples 2025"
4. **Common Issues Search**: "[technology] common problems solutions examples 2025"
5. **Latest Updates Search**: "[technology] updates changes examples 2025 2026"
6. **Real-World Examples Search**: "[technology] real world projects examples 2025"

## Integration with SpecDev Workflow
- **Requirements Phase**: Search for domain-specific requirements and compliance standards
- **Design Phase**: Search for architecture patterns and technology-specific design guidance  
- **Tasks Phase**: Search for implementation tutorials and step-by-step guides
- **Error Resolution**: Search for specific error solutions and troubleshooting guides

## Example Workflow
1. **Identify Information Need**: "I need to implement user authentication in a React app"
2. **Perform Targeted Searches**:
   ```
   Search: "React authentication implementation 2025 best practices examples"
   Search: "React JWT authentication tutorial examples 2025"
   Search: "React auth0 integration guide examples 2025"
   Search: "React authentication security considerations examples 2025"
   ```
3. **Synthesize Information**: Combine insights from multiple sources
4. **Apply to Project**: Use the latest, most relevant information for implementation

This approach ensures you always have access to the most current information and best practices available.
